# und_action
… a collection of pure data patches and accompanying helper scripts used in interactive installations at the 2014 "[... und Action! Wie werden Film und Fernsehen gemacht?](https://www.deutsche-kinemathek.de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/2014/und-action)"-exhibition at [Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum für Film und Fernsehen](https://www.deutsche-kinemathek.de/).

## casting
a mockup of a casting studio. visitors are invited to replay a scene, which will be recorded and replayed to them.
## greenscreen
a mockup of a newsroom dedicated to children. a camera grabs the visitors interacting with pre-recorded hosts in a green screen environment, the resulting chroma-keyed video is displayed in real time.
## syncro
a mockup of a dubbing studio, the hosts are invited to re-record the audio track for an animation film.

## notes regarding the setup
unfortunately, all audio and video material is not part of this repository - this is due to possible issues regarding their copyright. for capturing the live camera images resp. getting the frames into puredata's gem environment, blackmagic capture cards, ffmpeg and video4linux loopback devices were used. fluxbox as a minimal windows manager was a natural choice, compton took care of tearing.
